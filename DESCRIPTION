Description: The ReactomeGSA packages uses Reactome's online analysis service to perform a multi-omics
    gene set analysis. The main advantage of this package is, that the retrieved results can be 
    visualized using REACTOME's powerful webapplication.
    Since Reactome's analysis service also uses R to perfrom the actual gene set
    analysis you will get similar results when using the same packages (such as limma and edgeR) locally.
    Therefore, if you only require a gene set analysis, different packages are more suited.
